# Wordpress Install Automation
This is my first Bash script, so there may be bugs and some unstable commands in it.

This script is designed to automatically create a web server with just a few initial inputs. I created this script because I've installed WordPress manually so many times for class projects. I made this to make it easier for me when I need to do it again in the future.

Yes i know Bash script is not a good way to do this kind of thing. The privacy and security is worst. I'll back maybe with Ansible or something else to work around that.


added plain python code for funsies :D and remote testing -- R.K
